A hack4la project for connecting artist, businesses, and the appreciating public to beautify Los Angeles.

========

Please do not take this code seriously. It was a 24 hr hack-a-thon project. Even the repository name has a typo. This project has changed a small amount since the single commit you see. Even then, the commited code is slightly behind what we used for our demo purposes. We do plan on developing it further, but have not had much time to date.
